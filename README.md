# LokaSync Android App

This app is used to monitor some IoT nodes in real-time. Currently, we've connected two nodes: **an ESP32 with a DHT11 sensor (node 1)** and an **ESP32 with a TDS sensor (node 2)**. This app is built with Flutter and is **still in the development phase**. Actually, the main purpose of this app is to monitor the status of updated firmware in IoT devices (ESP32), whether it's success or failure.
